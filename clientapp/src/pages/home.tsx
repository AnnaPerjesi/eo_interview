            Before delete - I usually make a Dialog If you really want to delete
            or not, but now I have not enough time
          </li>
          <li>
            I've messed up with delete, because I have not used the isActive
            property (sorry, I should read more carefully)
          </li>
          <li>Missing server side validation - big no -</li>
          <li>
            I had to redesign some of the tasks, because I have not enough
            knowledge but less time than I thought

            I really enjoyed this task, but it take a lot of time to make it
            work. (especially for a junior position)
